I represent a column within a columned list. A column has associated title and a cell stencil builder.

Cell stencil builder builds a stencil or an element for each cell within a columned list taking row value, row index and current column index into account.

[[[
| aColumn |

aColumn := BrListColumn new.
aColumn title: 'Column'.
aColumn stencil: [ :aRowValue :aRowIndex :aColumnIndex | BrListLabelStencil new text: aRowValue asString ].
aColumn	
]]]
